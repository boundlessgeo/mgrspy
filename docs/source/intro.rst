============

The military grid reference system (MGRS) is the geocoordinate standard used
by NATO militaries for locating points on the earth. See `this Wikipedia
article <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_grid_reference_system>`_ for
more details.

*mgrspy* is a Python package which allows you to convers WGS84 coordinates
(latitude and longitude) to MGRS coordinates and back.
